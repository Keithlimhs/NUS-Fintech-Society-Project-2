# NUS-Fintech-Society-Project-2
This is a project on credit card fraud detection done as part of the Fintech society project 2 assignment. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), and it contains features V1 to V28 which are principal components obtained from PCA. The only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Due to confidentiality issues, more background information about the data as well as the original features are not provided. 

Upon exploring the data, it can be seen that it is highly imbalanced, and normalization has to be done on the column 'Amount' before the models can be trained. As this is a classification task, I trained 6 classification models, namely Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and XGBoost. I used the accuracy score, F1 score and confusion matrix to evaluate the effectiveness of each algorithm, and all 3 metrics shows that the K-Nearest Neighbours model was the best in the prediction results. Hence I intend to use the K-Nearest Neighbours model as the final model and do some optimization to improve the accuracy, such as GridsearchCV and bagging
